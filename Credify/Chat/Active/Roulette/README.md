## Roulette Rules & Flow

**Gameplay Flow:**

1. **Place Bets:** Players have a limited time window to place their bets using their in-game credits on the betting table.
2. **Spin the Wheel:** The game (or a designated player if you want to automate less) initiates the spin of the virtual roulette wheel.
3. **Ball Lands:** The ball randomly lands in one of the numbered and colored slots.
4. **Determine Winners:**  Winning bets are determined based on the ball's landing spot.
5. **Payout Winnings:**  Credits are automatically awarded to players with winning bets according to the payout structure (see below).
6. **Next Round:** The game resets, and a new round begins with players placing their bets.
